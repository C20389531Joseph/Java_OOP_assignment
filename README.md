1. Topic Modeller

Initial plan
1. Control class - use to interact with end user and display results
2. File read class - use to read, select files, and to clean files, i.e. remove stop words
3. Compare file class - use to compare file
4. Calculate results class - use to do calculations
5. GUI class - GUI
6. Edit clean doc class - use to add additional stop words
7. Save results class - used to save results
The link "http://www.lextek.com/manuals/onix/stopwords1.html" does not work for me. I am using the stop word list from github "https://gist.github.com/sebleier/554280" for my assignment.
